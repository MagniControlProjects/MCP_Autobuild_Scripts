 *   Contains a helper object as an initial test to see how objects work. 
 *   Object will grow to support minimal requirements in jobs.
 *   The assumption is made that jenkins Environment variables are present.
 *   
 *   Notes:
 *   evaluate is a key term for importing script. load abstracts a layer up from this.
 *   Objects cannot pull or set from environment. therefore all must be handed over manually.
